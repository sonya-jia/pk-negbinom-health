# 🇵🇰✨ PK Health Analysis: Doctors & Poverty Study 📊🏥

Welcome to the **PK Health Analysis** repo! 🎉 Here, we explore the relationship between poverty levels and the number of doctors across different districts in Pakistan using Poisson and multilevel modeling. 📈👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️

## 📚 Project Overview

This project uses data from the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) 🇵🇰 to understand how poverty affects healthcare availability across Pakistan's provinces and districts. We apply statistical models to answer questions like:

- How does poverty impact the number of doctors? 🤔
- Are there differences across provinces? 🗺️
- What type of models fit count data best? 📊

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- `R` and `tidyverse` for data wrangling and visualization 🧹📊  
- `sf` for geographic data and mapping 🗺️  
- `glmmTMB` and `MASS` for advanced modeling 🎯  
- `ggplot2` & `ggrepel` for pretty plots 🎨
