Though initially there was to be a Political Officer acting as the Administrative Head of the Khyber Agency (Political Agent's Officer, Khyber Agency), in actual fact in 1902 a full-fledged Political Agency was assigned here. It draws its name from historic Khyber Pass and covers an area of 2576 sq. km. The famous Torkham border links the Khyber agency with Afghanistan's Nangarhar province. It has an estimated population of 546730 and is comprised of people from Afridi, Shinwari, Mulagoori and Shalmani tribes.",2576,701175,111588,4,,986973,383,105,97540,889433,505475,481487,11,,,,,328,,158829,,,,,,881.7,,,6,1273,,20,4,190,86,55,515747,,,,,,479,36,38,4,50.2,34.81,38.26,39.57,,KPK

28,Mohmand,"The Mohmand Agency was created in 1951, four years after creation of Pakistan as sovereign state in 1947. The Mohmand Agency shares a border with the Bajaur Agency to the north, the Dir district to its east, the district of Peshawar to its southeast and Afghanistan to the west.

Mohmand agency is the area of rugged mountains with barren slopes and widespread along the banks of the Kabul river. The sources of income are very limited in general except from agriculture and some trade/businesses. Most of the locals are earning their livelihood in the foreign countries especially at Gulf States.

Mohmand Agency is well connected with the rest of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province through Roads. Pir Qala - Yakaghund - road is a major highway running through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It starts from Peshawar and terminates at the entrance to Bajaur Agency where it joins the above mentioned Munda - Khar - Nawagai road. This route from Peshawar to Mohmand Agency and then to Bajaur Agency is used for supply of food items to the agencies as well as transportation of minerals from the Agencies to the settled area. This route is also important because of the fact that the major clusters of marble mines lies alongside it. The road requires rehabilitation through resurfacing, widening and alignment at some locations

The prominent sectors include Agriculture and Minerals; Chilies, wheat, and vegetables are predominant products in Agriculture while Marble, Manganese, Quartz, etc. in Minerals. Trade is a major source of livelihood in the tribal areas after agriculture and livestock. Most of the trading activity in Mohmand relates to wholesaling/retailing and transportation of consumer goods, minerals and agriculture produce. Markets in Mohmand agency are relatively weak and are highly dependent upon markets in settled areas. Road Infrastructure in Mohmand Agency is badly damaged and in disrepair. This directly affects trading activities Investment made towards improving infrastructure and facilities available at these markets will have a meaningful and sustainable impact on increasing trade across this region. Trading activity is reasonably dominant and around 40-50 truck loads per day cross the border to Afghanistan using two crossings; Yaqubi Kandao and Lwar Ghakhai. The major goods moving from Pakistan to Afghanistan includes timber, poultry, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. and the ones moving to Pakistan includes Electronic goods, fruit, dry fruits, vehicles, vehicle parts, etc. Destinations for imported goods are Bajaur, Shabqadar, Peshawar, Charsadda, and Mardan. A main road runs through the corridor to Afghanistan

Geological studies reveal that the area lies in the western tip of Kohistan Island Arc with the Main Mantel Thrust runs roughly in the east-west direction in the area. Along the southeastern and eastern parts of both agencies, a mixture of rock unit called the Mélange zone occupies the area. This area is rich in mineral potential, such as, gemstone, metallic minerals and dimension stones. The area mainly comprises igneous and metamorphic rock formations with minor sedimentary sequence.

An estimated 1,150 million tons of good grade marble deposits of different shades and colors occur at Ziarat, Spinkai Tangi, Sar Lara Kandao, Chamarkand, Shin kamar, Jandai, Koh-e-more, Gumbatai and Sagi areas of 17 Mohmand Agency

The famous Ziarat marble deposit is located west of Lakaro, about 8 km from main Mohmand-Bajaur road (Map). The marble formation covers a considerable large area with workable marble reserves of more than100 million tons.

Major concentration of chromite deposits exists in Bucha & Rangmena, Balola, Balogai, Jau, Kawal and Bazargai in Prang Ghar area and Tsapari Tangi, Jawar Mena, Gumbatai and Lakarai areas of Mohmand Agency. Production of chromite from Mohmand Agency is mostly exported to China.

Manganese deposits are located in the eastern part of Mohmand agency. Five manganese bodies have been discovered at Qazi Mula Ziarat, Bamdara, Kamangara Kandao and Kharai Dara in Safi & Ambar areas, whereas, more than 38 prospects have been identified at 22 locations within a 10 km linear zone covering Nasir Kasai, Maizar Pai Khan and Ziarat/Razam Dherai in Parang Ghar 20 area, Mohmand Agency. Some of these are quite large (i.e.115 meter long and 10 meter wide) with 35-66% MnO2 (manganese dioxide) content. Other manganese deposits in the Agency are being evaluated under an ongoing FATA Development Authority (FDA) scheme called “Investigation & Evaluation of Manganese Prospects in Bajaur & Mohmand Agencies.”

Gem quality emerald has been reported from Tora Tiga in Mohmand Agency. Geological studies conducted under on-going FDA scheme “Exploration & Evaluation of Precious Stones in Bajaur & Mohmand Agencies” resulted in identification of a number of promising emerald bearing zones in the a forementioned 22 areas. Previously emerald was mined at these localities using indiscriminate
blasting method which resulted in very little recovery of commercial grade emerald which led to mine closures.",2296,560765,48118,7,,466984,203,104,,466984,238003,228981,0,,,,,339,,237730,,,,,,607.54,,,4,661,,22,2,118,69,322,298559,,,,,,459,60,31,2,,26.18,22.9,26.18,,KPK
29,North Waziristan,"North Waziristan is the northern part of Waziristan in Northwest Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan. Waziristan named after ‘Wazir’ main tribe in the area. North Waziristan lies between 32.35° to 33.22° latitudes and 69.22° to 70.38° longitudes. It is bounded in the North by Khost province of Afghanistan, Kurram District and Hangu District, in the East by Bannu and Lakki Districts, in the South lies District South Waziristan and in the West is Paktika province of Afghanistan.

Agriculture and remittances are probably the two most important sources of income for the vast majority of inhabitants. Area mainly consists of rugged nature of terrain with scarce water resources. Also majority of population is not well educated. These factors make locals rely mainly on government services and jobs. Enlisting in militia and army has also been a traditional source of employment and it is still important. Short-term unskilled employment on development projects (roads, irrigation systems etc) and longer term employment as chowkidars on some schemes has become more important during the last two decades. A large number of men are working abroad. Those who can no longer emigrate for work, choose to go to Karachi or other major cities in the country. However, remittances earned in Pakistan are substantially lower than those earned overseas. Transport of goods and people is another significant factor.

A large number of the population depends upon small businesses like running shops for day to day needs. Hubs of shops/markets have been established all across North Waziristan to facilitate livelihood of the people. Markets like Miran Shah market has become epitome of modernized economic hub. In addition, fruit and animal market activities are also being undertaken.

A trade terminal is being established at Ghulam Khan in collaboration with National Logistics Cell. Ghulam Khan gains a national and international significance owning to the presence of major transit/ trade route not only with Afghanistan but also with Central Asian Countries.

Pine nut harvesting is another major revenue generation source for locals of tehsil Shawal. After clearance of area from militants, Pine nut collection was resumed by tribals after security clearance in year 2017 and total of 1376 tons of pine nut was collected from an area of 231 Square Kilometers of tehsil Shawal.

Most of North Waziristan is mountainous hence major portion of its land is uncultivable. However, patches in valleys, mostly near nullah beds are being used for cultivation. Tochi river valley is composed of rich alluvial soil and is very productive. Farming is also done in Kaitu and Khaisora valleys. Maize and Wheat are major crops being grown in the area. Rice and Barley are also grown.

Area has potential for establishment of micro hydro projects; so far 4 x micro hydro projects have been developed and more are expected to be developed.

Kurram Tangi Dam and irrigation canals planned on Kurram and Kaitu rivers in North Waziristan Agency would be a major leap forward towards supplementing agriculture, irrigation and power generation of the District with approximate cost of Rs. 30 Billiion. It will irrigate 16,380 acres of land and will have hydro-power generation capacity of 83.4 MW. The dam will also supplement 278,000 acres of existing system. Dam is expected to be completed by March 2020.

North Waziristan is a mineral rich area with number of mountains full of natural resources; many are still untapped.

Shinkai – Degan Mining Site is situated 19 Kilometers West  of Miran Shah. The site was identified in 1985 having high perspective of copper reserves (122 million metric ton). Project for copper exploration has been initiated by Mineral Exploration and Development Organization (MEDO) in May 2016. Raw copper will be processed through Beneficiation Plant to bring the copper contents from 0.386% to 22-25% to enhance its value. As per MOU, locals are shareholders in the profit, while a fixed percentage will be spent on area development.

Some Iron and Coal reservoirs also exist in Charmina and Ghuza areas of tehsil Datta Khel. Geological investigations and surveys are under process to assess amount of these deposits and estimate for their recovery. Reportedly, unexplored deposits of Quartz stones are also available in Miran Shah area. In some hills ordinary stones are mined for construction of buildings etc.

Some reserves of Oil, Gas and Petroleum are also expected in Mir Ali and Spinwam area. Marri Petroleum Corporation Limited (MPCL) is carrying out survey of the area since January 2018 to explore Gas, Petroleum and minerals.

Animals make an important contribution to farm family economy. Milk and eggs improve the diet, and animal manure is critical to crop production.",4707,1222846,59003,9,,543254,115,106,538893,4361,280232,263015,7,,,,,37,,218120,,,,,,803.1,,,10,3077,,14,9,330,111,6,162854,,,,,,722,72,38,1,,69.75,67.16,48.52,,KPK

32,Attock,"District Attock is surrounded on the North by Swabi and Haripur districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on the East by Rawalpindi, on the South by Chakwal district, on the South-West by Mianwali district, in the West by Kohat district and on North-West by Nowshera district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Indus River flows along the Western boundary of the district for about 130 Kilometers. It divides Attock district from the three bordering districts of Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa.
Attock is the Eastern terminus of the Kabul-Attock and is a corridor to the Central Asia. However unlike the modern highways, this corridor is not a work of engineering marvel but an act of nature as it was naturally carved through the Hindu Kush Mountains by the legendry Kabul River and its numerous tributary rivers and streams. The 435 miles long journey of River Kabul starts just West of the Kabul city in Afghanistan and ends at Attock where it ultimately falls into the River Indus.
Attock is a place of great historic significance. Emperor Akbar the Great, the grandson of Babar, recognized the strategic importance of this area in 1581 and built the famous Attock Fort Complex. The fall of Mughal Empire in eighteenth century saw the rise of Sikhs in Punjab and Durrani Afghans to the West. Attock became a battle ground between two contending powers. British finally ended the feud by subjugating both Sikhs and Afghans in the nineteenth century. British at the same time also brought rail line to the area, built first permanent bridge in 1880 over the Indus River. The district was named as Campbellpur after the name of Sir Campbell who laid foundation stone of Campbellpur City in 1908 a few kilometers away on South-East of Attock Khurd Town. The district was constituted in 1904 by taking Talagang tehsil from Jhelum district and Pindi Gheb, Fateh Jang and Attock tehsils from Rawalpindi district. The city was renamed as Attock in 1978.

The Agriculture department comprises of seven different allied departments. The Executive District Officer, being the official head of the group of seven District Officers, is responsible for its efficient administration, discipline and for the proper conduct of business assigned to the group of the offices.

Special Rabi Campaign is launched during Rabi every year under Wheat Productivity Enhancement Program. Farmers are trained in modern wheat production technology by Agriculture Graduates at village level.  This program is completed in three phase every year.  Agriculture graduate visit all villages according to a schedule program to disseminate modern agriculture technology to the farmers especially about wheat crop.  Other Rabi crops are also brought under discussion during training session with other farming problems.  This training is completed in three phases. First phase is about land preparation and deep tillage, while in second phase, farmers are told about seed bed preparation, fertilizer doses, seed rate, improved seed, sowing depth, proper sowing time etc.  The third phase is follow-up phase.
Besides, farmers are contacted by Agriculture (Extension) staff at different times for their guidance in farming practices to boost up their per acre yield.  Check is also kept on availability and quality control of Agriculture inputs i.e. fertilizers, pesticides and water management.
Gurudwara Panja Sahib is situated at Hasan Abdal, 48 km from Rawalpindi. This is one of the most holy places of Sikhism because of the presence of a rock believed to have the hand print of Guru Nanak imprinted on it. Twice a year, Sikhs visit this Gurdwara from all over the world.

Wind and storms are quite common during the summer. The average annual rainfall in the district is 119 mm. The district may be divided into three parts according to the soil condition, i.e., the riverain area, the canal irrigated plain and the desert area. The riverain area of the district lies close to the Sutlej river which flows in the North-West along its border with Okara, Pakpattan, Sahiwal and Vehari districts. The land in this area is irrigated by non-perennial canals. During the summer monsoons, the area is generally inundated by river water. The canal irrigated area is the plain area which has been brought under cultivation by the canals. The desert area of the district is called the Cholistan. The surface of this desert consists of a succession of sand dunes, rising in places to a height of 150 meters.
 
Major crops of district Bahawalnagar are wheat, sugarcane, cotton, rice and rape/mustard seeds. At present, there are flour mills, sugar mills, cotton ginning/pressing factories and oil expelling units.

The mighty Indus River flows on the Western side of the District which plays havoc during monsoon season and the Jhelum and  Chenab rivers both flow on the eastern side. They also sometimes play havoc during monsoon season. One third of the land is sandy of which small portion is irrigated by Thal canal. Rest of the sandy land is cultivated and is entirely dependent upon rains. People mostly depend on agriculture which is highly dependent on rain falls.

Bhakkar Forest Division came into being under Thal Development Authority (TDA) in the year, 1952. When the development of Thal tract started, government decided to allocate waste land for afforestation in order to stabilize shifting sand dunes and for the production of timber and firewood. In 1951, this tract was handed over to Punjab Forest Department.The forest area is around 15531 acres. There is also linear plantation of 1345 km alongside the road/rails/canals in the district. The popular trees of this area are kikar and shisham.

Another historian has stated that the settlement was called. Chandikot at that time. When Sikandar-i-Azam attacked Punjab in 325 BC, he encamped his forces in the surroundings of this settlement. Chankia a renowned scholar and great politician, who was an Advisor to Chandar Gupt Mooriah during 305 to 298 BC has named Chiniot as his native town in his famous book “Earth Shaster”. According to one tradition Chinese traders used to come to this place in the very old days and called it Cheenot. Another tradition connects its foundation to farmers‟ tribe “Chandana” who lived here in reed huts. 

Chiniot is situated on North West of Chenab River. It is located at distance of 86 Km from Jhang and is connected by 60 feet wide metalled road. The town of Chiniot is also connected with major cities namely Lahore, Faisalabad and Sargodha by metalled road. Lahore is 160 Km, Faisalabad is 30 Km while Sargodha is 58 Km away. 

Chiniot is very famous for its furniture industry. Most of the furniture showrooms are located along Shahra-e-Quaid-e-Azam whereas most of the furniture factories are found on the western edge of the city.

39,Faisalabad,"The Faisalabad district is surrounded on the North and West by Hafizabad, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh districts respectively. In the East it touches Sheikhupura and in the South it is bounded by river Ravi, across which lies Okara.

A tiny town founded only to act as an agricultural market/mandi has now grown into a giant size metropolitan city, which enjoys third position in the country, as far as population and industrial growth is concerned. The present Faisalabad district came into existence in 1904 as Lyallpur district. Earlier, it was a Tehsil of Jhang district. During the later part of the 19th century, the Government of India initiated a great system of artificial irrigation through construction of canals.
The area of Faisalabad district was part of three districts via Gujranwala, Jhang and Sahiwal. This area was located between river Ravi and River Chenab and formed part of Rachna Doab. The name Lyallpur was given with a view to pay tribute to Sir James Lyall, Lt. Governor of Punjab, for his services rendered in colonization of the lower Chenab valley.
The design of the town was prepared by Captain Pophan Young C.I.E, a colonization officer. In 1896, Lyallpur tehsil comprised of Gujranwala, Jhang and Sahiwal and was under the administrative control of district Jhang.
The soil is fertile but salinity and water logging affect some areas. Major crops and fruits of district Faisalabad are wheat, sugarcane, rice, maize, citrus, guava and mangoes. A variety of vegetables are also grown in the district. 

Faisalabad district has made rapid strides in the field of industry after independence. It is now called the ""Manchester of Asia"" for its extensive development of textile industry. This development has been made possible by the continued efforts of pioneering entrepreneurs as well as workers over a period of four decades. Before independence, there were only five industrial units in Faisalabad City (then Lyallpur). Now, there are dozens of textile mills with other subsidiary units. Roughly, there are 512 large Industrial units, out of which 328 are Textile units, 92 engineering units and 92 of chemicals and food processing units. Other industries include hosiery, carpet and rugs, nawar and lace, printing and publishing and pharmaceutical products etc. There are also some 12,000 house-hold industries, which include some 60,000 power loom factories.

In 1947 there were 4 big Floor Mills, one Textile Mill, 12 Ginning units and 6 Engineering units. A few other industrial units also existed at that time. After independence, the large-scale migration of population, which included skilled workers and entrepreneurs, adversely affected the industrial set up. The government support also encouraged the entrepreneurs considerably, which resulted in rapid industrialization mostly in the textile sector.
An Industrial estate on Sargodha Road has been developed by Punjab Small Industrial Corporations (PSIC) over as area of 244 acres. Establishment of Industry in the estate is highly convenient because of availability of all the infra-structure through the PSIC.

Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a very strong and recognized chamber, which functions for the improvement and betterment of the business and industrialists community. The Chamber also gives suggestions to Federal Finance, Commerce Ministry, Provincial Finance, Excise and Taxation Ministry and Central Board of Revenue in formulating budget proposals or tax recovery proposals.
Besides Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, there are number of other industrial associations each related to different sector of Industry or business. The role of these associations is similar to the role of Chamber but restricted to the sector concerned and relatively confined to lower tiers of the government.
The important Associations contributing to the Industrial growth are appended below:
All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) Regional office, Lahore
All Pakistan Textile Processing Mills Association, Susan Road, Faisalabad
All Pakistan Bed Sheets and up-Hosiery Association, New Civil Lines, Faisalabad

40,Gujranwala,"The district lies in between two main cities, in North is the Gujrat and in South, there are Sheikhupura and Lahore. The Chenab river forms the Northern boundary of the district. Beyond the river, it is bounded by Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin districts, on the East by Sialkot district, on the South by Sheikhupura district and on the West by Hafizabad district.

Rice, Wheat and Sugarcane are the main crops grown in the district. The source of irrigation is perennial and non perennial canals supplemented by tub wells. Rice and Wheat are major food crops while Rice dominates with an earning of about Rs.15 millions as foreign exchange. Besides, Jawar, Bajra, Mash, Moong, Masoor, Gram, Maize, Tobacco, Oil Seed such as Rape/Mustard and sunflower are also grown in minor quantities in the district
Guavas and Citrus are main fruits grown in the district. Besides, Peaches, Jaman and Banana are also grown in minor quantities in the district. The major vegetables grown in the district are Potatoes, Cauliflower, Turnip, Onion, Peas, Carrot, Tomato, Ladyfinger and Garlic. Besides, Bitter Gourd and Chillies are also grown in the district in minor quantities.
The human settlements in Gujranwala existed since antiquity. The first name of the settlement according to the compilers of the first edition of the district gazette was Khanpur Shansi after an individual of the Jat tribe called Khan Shansi who founded 11 villages in the nearby area. Gujjar also settled in the Gujranwala region. They reach such dominance that the town came to be known as Gujranwala. It seems likely that the district once contained the capital of the Punjab, at an epoch when Lahore had not begun to exist.
We learn from the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hsuan Tsang, that about the year 630 A.D. he visited a town known as Tse-kia (or Taki), the metropolis of the whole country of the five rivers. A mound near the modern village of Asarur has been identified as the site of the ancient capital. Until the Muslim rule little is known of Gujranwala, except that Taki had fallen into oblivion and Lahore had become the chief city. ‘Under Muslim rule the district flourished for a time; but a mysterious depopulation fell upon the tract, and the whole region seems to have been almost entirely abandoned. The Compilers of the district Gazetteer Gujranwala date this name to Approximately 300 years, giving us a rough estimate of the middle of the 16th century. Other smaller town in the vicinity for example Sohdara Eminabad Wazirabad and Ghakhar have older antecedent than Gujranwala itself.
The Sikhs occupied the Punjab after the death of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir in 1707. Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the most powerful of all the Sikh rulers and ruled over for 40 years. After his death in 1840 the Sikh Empire was divided and disintegrated. The area was conquered and annexed by the British in 1849. A railway line was built along Grand Trunk Road in 1881. That railway line interconnected Gujranwala with other cities of Punjab and made the commercial trade between cities more convenient. British ruled the city until Pakistan's independence in 1947.
After independence Gujranwala was developed and it is now leading city of Pakistan. It is now an agricultural marketing center (grains, melons, sugarcane); it is also a commercial and industrial center, manufacturing ceramics, iron safes, copper, brass, and aluminum utensils. The establishment of an industrial park, textile, silk, pipefitting, electric fan, and tannery production increased its importance. Cultivation in the surrounding area is dependent upon canal irrigation. Wheat, cotton, rice, barley, and millet are the chief crops. One of the best quality Rice grows in Gujranwala.
In 1951, the city was converted into the capital of the district, which gave rise to the new industries in the city. The Gujranwala hydroelectric project provides power from the Chenab River. There are also rice and sugar mills and glassworks in the locality. City has an International Level Cricket Stadium, Jinnah Stadium also or formerly known as Municipal Stadium.
Gujranwala district is one of the major industrially developed district of the country. It possesses the requisite social/physical infrastructure and industrial base for the manufacture of specialized electrical/electronic products and industrial machinery to meet the overall requirement of the country such as distribution/power transformer, electricity/gas/water meters, circuit breakers, electric appliances, wires/cables, calculators, computers, machine tools, etc.",3622,4368.728,747214,5,166,5014196,1384,102,2948936,2065260,2533117,2480828,251,86525,,,,"143,000",,"168,000",36742645,19044,1659520,1568419,0.064,2869.59,,747144,,,,,16,1689,,,"4,030,000",100,98,9,0,97,1085,302,258,13,79.27,96.26,99.63,99.18,,Punjab

There are some important industries operating in district Gujrat such as auto tyres/tubes, textile, porcelain, tableware, pottery/ceramics, electric fans/motors/appliances, footwear, etc.

Major crops and fruits of district Gujrat are Wheat, Rice, Citrus and Guava. There are flour mills, rice husking units, vegetable ghee unit and wood pulp unit in the district.

District Gujrat is quite rich in forest resources.

42,Hafizabad,"The district is located at a longitude between 73°0 -12 and 73°0 -46 East and at a latitude between 31°0 -45 and 32°0 -20 North. The district spread over an area of 2367 square kilometer. It is surrounded by Gujranwala to the East, Jhang, Sargodha and river Chenab to the West, Faisalabad to the South, Mandi Baha-ud-Din to the North West, and district Sheikhupra to the South East.

The whole district is a flat alluvial plain divided between low lying alluvial bands and an uplands area. The district is irrigated largely through tube wells as well as to a lesser degree by the lower Chenab Canal.

Hafizabad is a very old city. In ancient times, when in 327 B.C Sikandar-e-Azam attacked  Hindustan, this territory ""Sandal Bar"" , (where is now the current Hafizabad is located ) was a populated area . Big cities were located in this territory and a lot of sub states were organized in the presidency of Maharajaz and Rajaz. In Sixth century, the famous Chinese tourist Hewang Sayan when came here, this area was not developed. Then the tourist moved to Sangla , he stayed in Jai Pura, located near village Koriala, but afterwards this territory became unpopulated and jungle-like area because of shortage of water and Afghan attackers.
The situation remained the same till King Akbar's Period. King Akbar once came here for hunting. King lost his companions as he went far away while hunting. The King felt thirst and wanted to drink some water. Suddenly he saw the signs of smoke; he followed the way and found a Sarmast in a cottage. King asked to arrange some water, there was no water, but Sarmast called up the grazing deer and milked to serve the King. King drank the milk and thanked Sarmast and asked if he had any wish or desire. Faqir Sarmast asked to build a town for his followers. King promised and ordered his advisor Hafiz Meerak to construct and build a city.
Hafiz Meerak built a town and the town was named after his name Hafizabad . Another authentic reference says that King Akbar wanted to name this town as Akbarabad.
Many thousand years old caste system is still dominating the social set up of the district. People of Hinjra and Aheer Caste were settled in District Hafizabad. However, Saansi, Gigray, Jogi, Rawal, Deendar, Malah, Bhirwaly, Faqeer, Bhandha and Pakhiwas are also living here. The major castes before partition were Bhatti, Kharal and Tarar.

Hafizabad is famous for its rice production. The Hafizabad City Grain Market and Jalpur Bhattian Grain Market are the biggest rice export centers of the country.The majority of population in the district is Muslim, while Christians and Ahmadis inhabit the areas in small numbers with the share of 2.9% and 0.1%, respectively.

Rice occupies 2.5 million hectare that is 10.9% of the total cultivated area with production of 5.1 million tonnes of milled rice.

43,Jhang,"Jhang District is situated in the central Punjab and lies between 30.37 to 31.59 degree North latitudes and 71.37 to 73.13 degree East longitudes. The district Jhang is adjoined by Toba Tek Singh and Faislabad to the East, Hafizabad to the North-East, Khanewal on the South, Sargodha on the North, Khushab, Bhakkar and Layyah on the West.

The area was inhabited at the time of Alexander but the present city of Jhang was built in 1288 by Rai Sial with the advice of Hazrat Shah Jalal Bukhari (his peer). Sial tribe ruled this city for 360 years. It was then destroyed by the river and re-founded during the reign of Aurangzeb. Under Central Asian Mughal rule, the city flourished and was notable for commerce and trade.
In the late 18th century, it became part of the Afghan Empire. With disarray and chaos falling internal strife in Western Afghanistan and the gradual decline of the Mughal Empire, the city was briefly taken by Ranjit Singh in 1805. Later in 1849, the British made inroads into the Punjab and added Jhang to their expanding South Asian Empire.
During British Rule the towns of Jhang and Maghiana, lying two miles apart, became a joint municipality, then known as Jhang-Maghiana.
Most of the land is plain cultivable, except the area near the bank of River Chenab where there is a series of Kirana Hills. In the Western part, a desert area called Thal extends from the banks of the Jehlum River to the far West in the districts of Khushab and Bhakkar, while the Sandal Bar area arises from the Pabbarwala area near the Gujranwala boundary. No cultivation was possible in this wild area in past. Later, the British Colonial Government established a canal system and the town of Lyallpur (now Faisalabad) on 975 acres of land, which is now the textile industry hub of Pakistan.
Between the Jehlum and Chenab rivers, a small area of kirana bar is also located in this district, which ends at the Ghoriwala village. The area alongside the banks of rivers Ravi, Chenab and Jehlum is called Hitthar (area in which flood water reaches), while the upland area between bars and hitthar is called Utar.
The major crops of this district are Wheat, Cotton, Rice, Sugar Cane, Maize and Grams. The main fruits are Mango, Orange and Lemon.",8809,16002.196,427390,4,91,2743416,311,104,598190,2145226,1396612,1346660,144,12216,,,,"114,000",,"529,000",17897749,7975,573152,505577,0.196,2157.84,,214630,,,,,9,573,,,"953,000",92,99,7,2,60,1271,187,158,31,67.27,91.75,100,98.98,,Punjab

Urdu is the language spoken and understood by all. However majority of the people, especially those living in the city speak Punjabi. People living in cantonment are not generally the citizens of Jhelum and consist of army officials posted there that belong to different areas of the country. Hence Urdu is the main language spoken and understood by the people living in the cantonment.  The educated elite living in Jhelum also understand and speak English.

People of the Jhelum are simple and most of the population resides in villages. Major casts living in district Jhelum include Rajput, Jat, Kyanis. Since the area is not rich in agriculture, most of the people engage in different jobs other than cultivating crops. Life of the people living in Jhelum can be divided into people living in the city and those living in the cantonment. The people living in the cantonment are mainly the army officials while those living in the city are either landlords or own showrooms etc. People start their day early in the morning with male members of the house going to their work place and children going to schools. Female members of the house stay back and look after the house. However there are also women who work. The working women usually work as doctors and teachers.
The city is leading towards continuous development and advancement.  Initially the city lacked good market for clothing and other household items. People usually traveled to Rawalpindi or Lahore for the shopping. Now the trend is changing. The famous clothing brands including mushrooms. Leisure club, Chinyere, Bareeze and many more have now opened in Jhelum.
People of this area have gone abroad to earn their lively hood and most of them are settled in United Kingdom and Middle East. These people are a big source of foreign remittance and are contributing to the foreign exchange of the country.
Two main intercity roads facilitate communication in Jhelum. Motorway on its one side and Grand Trunk Road on the other.

The region is also covered with the railroad network in all of its main towns. The Jhelum Railway Station was built in 1928 during British rule before the independence of Pakistan. It was connected by the North-Western Railway to other cities in the Indian empire. Jhelum is on main line of Pakistan Railways, and linked to whole country through Railway line across Pakistan. Many of the railway lines and bridges were designed and constructed by exceptionally hardworking engineers during the British time and after independence in railway workshop Jhelum.

From the time of Alexander to the time of Mehmood Ghaznavi, no account of Depalpur is, however, available. In older times, Depalpur fell on the way to Delhi and, as such, was considered to be a place where an invader could be engaged.

59,Rahimyar Khan,"Rahim Yar Khan was previously known as Naushera which was built in 1751 A.D. by FazalIlahi Khan Halanion the ruins of ancient Phul Wadda during the Sumra Supremacy in Sind. In the year 1880 Lahore Karachi Railway Line was built. In 1881 the railway authorities desired to alter the name of the station, as Naushera was also the name of a station in Peshawar District. Consequently Nawab Muhammad Sadiq Khan named it Rahim Yar Khan after his first son Rahim Yar Khan who was given as a hostage to Kalhoras in 1809. It was a fertile land, due to fertility raw material such as cotton, sugarcane and wheat etc., were available which gave an incentive to ginning factories, so with passage of time ginning factories were cropped up. First of the Committee was established in the year 1905, which meant the recognition of the fact that Rahim Yar Khan grown into small urban centre by that time. The administration of the committee was run through the tesildar and centrally controlled by Bahawalpur Municipal Committee. At that time the District Head Quarter was Khanpur. Thereafter in the year of 1930 Rahim Yar Khan was designated as a District Head Quarter. In 1930 an extension development scheme was made, according to this scheme Jadeed Bazar, Sadar Bazar, Qazi Bazar, and School Bazar were developed.

Rahim Yar Khan is a commercial and industrial centre; it is connected with the rest of the country through rail and air including the other industrial hubs such as Lahore, Karachi, Quetta and Faisalabad. Industries include fertilizer, cosmetics, glass manufacturing, cotton production and processing, large textile units, flour mills, sugar and oil mills and large-scale power generation projects. Cotton production in Punjab Province starts from this area. Mango and Malta are two main fruits of this city. Cottage industries include ginning, pottery/clay products, agricultural machinery, handicrafts, and embroidery. Recently Punjab Chief Minister instructed to concerned department to identify lands. ""Maximum sites should be identified to set up industrial estates in the province, “The establishment of industrial estate in Rahim Yar Khan will produce far-reaching results as the district has airport facility near Bahawalpur and Cholistan. A modern slaughterhouse can be set up there too. Meat and other dairy products could be exported to Gulf States. The Punjab Government is taking effective measures for improving livestock sector and five dairy farms have been set up in Cholistan.

60,Rajanpur,"Rajanpur District derives its name from the town of Rajanpur which was founded by Makhdoom Sheikh Rajan Shah about 1770. Rajanpur District was carved out from Dera Ghazi Khan District in 1982. Rajanpur is situated on the right bank (west side) of River Indus. It is bounded on the north by Dera Ghazi Khan District, to the west by Dera Bugti district of Balochistan, to the east by Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts, in the south lies Kashmore District of Sindh Province. The Suleiman Mountains rise to the west of the district.

The Vedic period is characterized by Indo-Aryan culture that invaded from Central Asia and settled in Punjab region. The Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Madras, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas and Kurus invaded, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Rajanpur was ruled by Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and Shahi kingdoms.
In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region.
After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire invaded and occupied Rajanpur District. The Muslims faced restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of British rule, Rajanpur district increased in population and importance.
The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Rajanpur District.
Agriculture in Rajanpur depends solely upon canal irrigation since rainfall is negligible in the region. The five rivers of the Punjab meet at the locality of Wang near Mithankot; hence these rivers provide water for irrigation as well as for domestic usage. Rainfall occurs during the monsoon season (July–September). Occasional heavy rainfall causes flooding in this region, but such floods are rare. In Rajanpur, flood waters come from the Kah Sultan and Shacher torrents (rivulets), as well as the Indus.
Rajanpur district is famous for cotton and sugarcane crop, although they are cultivating wheat and rice as well and tobacco to very little extent too.

The industrial sector of Rajanpur hosts a number of industries complementing its agricultural sector. There are many rice mills and numerous cotton ginning factories. Sugar and textile mills have also been set up for easy transport of raw material to factories.",12318,34685.427,262490,4,69,1995958,162,106,337202,1658756,1028015,967878,65,2384,,,,"102,000",,"367,000",13703264,1275,63013,60451,0.357,1418.84,,30474,,,,,6,334,,,"173,000",100,100,27,9,51,966,86,69,11,66.97,68.66,98.69,97.17,,Punjab
61,Rawalpindi,"Rawalpindi is a city in the Potwar Plateau near Islamabad, the current capital of Pakistan. It is the military headquarters of the Pakistan Armed Forces and also served as the nation's capital while Islamabad was being constructed in the 1960s. The city is home to many industries and factories.
Islamabad International Airport is actually in Rawalpindi, and it serves the city along with the capital. Rawalpindi is located in the Punjab province, 275 km (171 miles) to the north-west of Lahore. It is the administrative seat of the Rawalpindi District. Rawalpindi, also known as Pindi, has a long history spread over several millennia. Archaeologists believe that a distinct culture flourished on this plateau as far back as 3000 years.
The material remains found at the site prove the existence of a Buddhist establishment contemporary to Taxila, but less celebrated than its neighbor. It appears that the ancient city went into oblivion as a result of the Hun devastation. The first Muslim invader, Mahmud of Ghazni (979-1030), gifted the ruined city to a Gakkhar Chief, Kai Gohar. The town, however, being on an invasion route, could not prosper and remained deserted until Jhanda Khan, another Gakkhar Chief, restored it and named it Rawalpindi after the village Rawal in 1493.
Rawalpindi remained under the rule of the Gakkhars till Muqarrab Khan, the last Gakkhar ruler, was defeated by the Sikhs in 1765. The Sikhs invited traders from other places to settle here. This brought the city into prominence. Following the British conquest of the Sikhs and their occupation of Rawalpindi in 1849, the city became a permanent garrison of the British army in 1851. In the 1880s a railway line to Rawalpindi was laid, and a train service was inaugurated on January 1, 1886. The need for having a railway link arose after Lord Dalhousie made Rawalpindi the headquarters of the Northern Command and Rawalpindi became the largest British military garrison in British India.
In 1951, Rawalpindi saw the murder of the first elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan, in Liaquat Garden. Today Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani Army and Air Force. The famous Murree Road has been a hot spot for various political and social events. Nala Lai, famous for its floods, runs in the middle of the city, dividing it into city area and Cantonment area. History describes Nala Lai water pure enough to do washing clothes but now it has become polluted with the waste water from all sources including factories and houses. It is rapidly developing into a large modern city. It has many good hotels, restaurants, clubs, museums, playgrounds. It has a number of parks, of which the largest is Ayub National Park. Rawalpindi is the nearest major city for the holiday resorts and hill stations of the Galiyat area, such as Murree, Nathia Gali, and Ayubia. It is also a common starting point for tourists visiting Abbottabad, Swat, Kaghan, Gilgit, Hunza, Skardu and Chitral.
The economy of Rawalpindi has a diverse industrial base. The main industries of the city include oil refineries, gas processing, steel manufacturing, iron mills, railroad yards, a brewery , sawmills, tent factories, textiles, hosiery, pottery, leather goods production, transport and tourism.",5285,312292.393,888765,7,174,5405633,1023,103,2875516,2530117,2741872,2663075,686,20857,,,,"29,000",,"254,000",142199340,12438,3700788,3046055,0.032,3645,,998897,,,,,17,3322,,,"1,572,000",95,100,47,18,95,1203,314,370,49,67.95,92.25,99.75,99.75,,Punjab
62,Sahiwal,"District Sahiwal is bounded by district Khanewal on the West, by district Okara on the East, by district Vehari on the South-West, by district Pakpattan on the South-East and district Bahawalnagar on the south. River Ravi flows on its North side. It is approximately 500 ft. above sea level and It roughly forms a parallelogram lying generally NE-SW along the Ravi River.
It is spread over an area of 3201 sq km and comprises two tehsils namely, Sahiwal and Chicawatni. Sahiwal District also contains many subtowns like Qadirabad, Yousafwala, Iqbalnagar, Kassowal, Noorshah, Harappa and Ghaziabad. There are transport connections via road and Pakistan railways to Lahore, and a regional airport under construction.Agriculture is important to the local economy, particularly the growing of cotton and grain. Cattle are also kept and Sahiwal is famous for its water, buffalo milk and presence of one of the ancient civilizations on archeological evidence dated 3000 to 5000 B.C. 15 miles southwest from downtown in suburb of Harapa which was the northern city of Indus Valley Civilization.
Harrapa is today a large village in the Sahiwal District of Punjab, 15 miles southwest of the district town. Archaeologists think that ancient Harappa was the urban center dominating the upper Indus region, much like Mohenjo-daro dominated the lower Indus Valley and Ganweriwala might have been the urban center for what is now Rajasthan. The site at Harappa was first briefly excavated by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1872-73, two decades after brick robbers carried off the visible remains of the city. He found an Indus seal of unknown origin.
The first extensive excavations at Harappa were started by Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni in 1920. His work and contemporaneous excavations at Mohenjo-daro first brought to the world's attention the existence of the forgotten Indus Valley civilization as the earliest urban culture in the Indian subcontinent. His work was followed later in the decade by that of Madho Sarup Vats, also of the Archaeological Survey of India. Excavations by other archaeologists continued in the 1930's, and in 1946 Sir Mortimer Wheeler excavated the so-called fortification walls and found the first pre-Indus Valley civilization (Kot Dijian) deposits. After independence in 1947 and coming in District Sahiwal of Province of Punjab, Pakistan, Harappa was excavated by Mohammed Rafique Mughal of the Archaeological Survey of Pakistan in 1966.
The traditional crafts of district Sahiwal include baskets and mats. The baskets are made from sticks of Mulberry trees, which are found in abundance in the forest located at Chichawatni. The baskets are used for packing of fruit and vegetables. The mats are made from naturally grown grass. These crafts are mainly concentrated in Chichawatni and its suburbs. Approximately, 400 artisans are engaged in these crafts. Apart from baskets and mats, there are a number of handlooms installed in Sahiwal for the manufacture of school tats from jute and about 500 persons are engaged in this trade.

63,Sargodha,"Sargodha is a combination of „Sar‟ and „Godha‟.‟Sar‟ is Hindi word meaning a water pond while „Godha‟ was the name of Hindu Faqir. The Hindu faqir named „Godha‟ used to live near a pond meant for storing of rain water for human/animal use. The place came to be known as Sargodha after the pond and the name of Hindu Faqir. Then pond which was later on filled up is now included in the area of the District Head Quarters Hospital.

The District headquarters were originally located at Shahpur city near the left bank of River Jhelum. In the great floods of 1849 the town was washed away. In view of flood danger, therefore, the Headquarters were shifted to ShahpurSadar but this site also did not serve the purpose as in the great floods of 1893 the district Headquarters got surrounded by water on all sides. In 1914 the District headquarters were shifted to Sargodha, although the district continued to be called Shahpur district till 1960. It was in 1960 that the District was name after Sargodha and became the Headquarters of the new Sargodha Division, comprising of the districts of Sargodha, Lyallpur, Jhang and Mianwali. In 1982 The Khushab district was established and also new division Faisalabad was created. Since that time the Sargodha division comprised Sargodha, Mianwali, Khushab and Bhakkar

Sargodha is largely an agricultural and industrial city. The vast fields in the city have allowed the farmers to develop a range of crops and animal breeding programs. Some of the main crops include citrus, wheat, rice, and sugar cane, which are exported to the other cities as well as internationally. Citrus fruits such as oranges (locally known as kinnows), guavas and mangoes are the main fruits grown in the district.

68,Badin,"Badin district is situated between latitude 24° 13’ to 25° 12’ North and longitude 68° 21’ to 69° 20’ East. The district is bounded in the north by Hyderabad, in the east by Mirpurkhas and Tharparker districts, in the south by the Arabian Sea and Rann6 of Kutch, which also forms the international boundary with India, and in the west it borders Thatta and Hyderabad districts. The district is part of the Lower Indus Plain formed by the alluvial deposits of the Indus River. Thus, its land is very uniform in character and hills or rivers do not diversify it; in fact, there are no rivers or streams in the district. The climate of Badin is relatively mild. The sea breezes keep the summers relatively cool. During the monsoon period the sky is cloudy, but there is very little precipitation. The climate in summer is generally moist and humid. The cold weather in Badin starts from the beginning of November, where there is a sudden change in temperature. There are very few plants other than trees and grasses in the region.” (Human Development Foundation).

Badin district can be broadly divided into two distinct economic zones. One zone supports purely agricultural income and the other one has a mixed economy, having fisheries along with agriculture as its main stay. The upper part of the district, comprising of Taluka Tando Bago, Matli and Talhar, falls in the first zone whereas, Taluka Golarchi (Shaheed Fazil Rahoo) and Badin up to Taluka Diplo of district Tharparker constitutes the mixed economic zone. At present, sugarcane is the major cash crop in the district. However, after 2003 floods, due to shortage of water, the cultivation pattern changed and people have started growing sunflower as an alternate crop. The entire land is irrigated by water coming from Sukkur and Kotri barrages. The irrigation network mainly comprises Gooni, Phulali, Akram Wah and Nasir canals.

Bulk of the population resides in rural areas of which 65 percent is engaged in farming and livestock rearing, and depends on these as their main sources of livelihood17. While the farming sector provides a major source of employment for the people in District Badin, land ownership is much skewed. There are either large cultivators/absentee landlords or very small cultivators (mainly small owners-cum tenants and sharecroppers) or labourers. For majority of the population most agriculturally related income comes from labour on other people's farms, which easily outweighs income from crop sales. Main Crops are Sugar Cane, Rice, Wheat and sunflower.

Some areas of Nagarparkar taluka are fertile as these are fed with tube well water and various crops such as wheat, onion, cotton and other vegetables are grown in this area. Except for the two mouzas of Mithi and seven mouzas of Diplo, which are irrigated, rest of the 157 mouzas are in the arid zone where cultivation depends on rains. Drought is a common phenomenon which occurs after every two years when there are no rains. Due to the nature of land, pulses are grown in this district, guarseed is famous among all.

Although the district is rich in mineral resources like china clay, granite, coal and salt, there is no industry in this district. Tharparkar coal fields are spread over 9,000 sq. km, from Islamkot to Mithi, famously known as Thar Coal. These are the largest coal deposits of the country and constitute 80% of coal deposits of Pakistan.

Since Tharparkar is a desert like area but still there are some families engaged in fisheries. The overall fish production is quite small in the district as compared to other fish producing district.","19,638","93,212.00",301625,7,64,1649661,84,115,132071,1517590,882365,767266,30,,,"6,149",,,,"752,000",0,0,0,0,0.481,1105,,,,,,,4,164,182,,,100,98,67,1,56,3716,247,47,,,14.75,19.25,51.09,,Sindh

There is one government poultry farm and small scale private/commercial poultry farms of broiler and layer breeds in the district.

Kharan has deposits of manganese, gabbro and chromite besides, Feldspar occurrence in the area has also been reported. Bunap – Rayo (Raskoh range) Chromite and Manganese occur about 30 kms north-west of Kharan District. This region contains the large ophiolitic complex extending north wards to Khuzdar. The ophiolitic complex is mainly comprised of ultramafic, mélange and other rock units. The ophiolite includes fragments and block of Peridotite, Dunite, Serpentente, Gabbro, Manganese and Chromite. The ophiolites contain lenticular or disseminated bodies of Manganese and Chromite and majority of these bodies are found as pods, lenses and many irregular shapes (in dunite rocks).

Mining is being carried out by the private sector mostly. The mining activity is based on primitive techniques and therefore results in wastage and inefficiency, which in turn brings lesser economic gains.

No significant industrial or manufacturing activities reported in the Kharan district.","48,051","314,740","24,035",3,8,"156,152",3.25,107.24,44655,111497,"80,805","75,347",0,,,,,,,14854,,,,,0.454,2395,,284,2,491,,1,1,14,45,,65649,100,100,100,41,81,186,34,20,,48.56,8.6,42.47,17.2,1,Balochistan

Location of Khuzdar is at 900 km (aerial distance) south-west (225 degrees bearing) of Pakistan's Capital City Islamabad and 270 km south (188 degrees bearing) from Quetta City, the provincial capital of Balochistan.

Khuzdar was separated from Kalat after having district status on 1 March, 1974. The district headquarter is in “Khuzdar” town. The district is located in the center of Balochistan, sharing its boundaries in the east with Sindh Province and Jhal Magsi, while Awaran and Washuk Districts are in the west. Lasbela is in the south and Kalat in north.

Khuzdar city is situated on the National Highway that links Pakistan with Iran and Turkey.

There is a significant amount of fish catch experienced in the streams of Moola, Naal and others but it is for the local consumption not for commercial purpose. Therefore, the fisherires department has not been formally established in the district and the relevant data has not been properly collected and updated.

Other than Marble, Lead and Zinc are also among main minerals. Common minerals of economic significance are Galena (PbS) and Sphelerite (Zn, Fe). Some of the important Lead Zinc prospects of District Khuzdar require detailed exploration. Gunga Lead Zinc Barite has deposit of 10 million tones according to preliminary estimates (Geological Survey of Pakistan) whereas Surmai Lead Zinc deposit are estimated at 3 million tons Iron Ore deposits of Hematite are of economic significance at different localities in ultramafic rocks near Monar Talar. 

These deposits are being mined by private sector and transported down the country in raw form. Strontium and Copper deposits of good quality have been reported too. The Barite mineral in chemical composition of BaSo4 owing to its high specific gravity is used in production of oil well drilling mud, in paints, chemical ceramics, paper industries and manufacture of barium chemicals. Its large deposits occur at Gunga 16 Km to south-east of Khuzdar city with ore in inter-bedded limestone and shale. The zone of mineralization is about 1,380 meters long. Massive Sulphide Copper deposits are also found in the area.

Major industry is not available; however, small enterprises in the area include carpet centers, woodwork, mazri making and furniture making workshops. Few cottage industries are also functional in the area where local embroidery work is carried out by women and girls. Major factors that limit the development of industry and manufacturing are non-existence of infrastructure and marketing network, unavailability of micro-credit and absence of skilled labor.

Agricultural products and minerals are exported to Karachi and Quetta. Almost all the consumer items are imported from Karachi, Quetta and various cities of Punjab. Some goods smuggled in from Iran via Kech and Panjgur are also available.","35,380",1280,"120,405",9,40,"802,207",22.67,110.59,277136,525071,421268,"380,939",0,,,,,,,103375,,,,,0.285,2867,,1235,4,1143,,19,1,30,54,,200479,100,100,28,13,99,647,65,39,,41.63,7.56,60.21,18.61,2,Balochistan
105,Killa Abdullah,"Killa Abdullah District lies between 66°14'23""-67°15'43"" East longitudes and 30°05'7""-31°18'46"" North latitudes. Location of Killa Abdullah is at 690 km (aerial distance) south-west of Pakistan's Capital City Islamabad and 70 km north from Quetta city, provincial capital of Balochistan.

Killa Abdullah was notified as separate district on 14 June, 1993. Formerly the district was a part of District Pishin. The name originates from Killa which means a fort, which was built by Sardar Abdullah Khan Achakzai who was an influential figure and one of the great leaders of Afghanistan-rebellion, in the year 1841. During the same rebellion, British envoy died. The fort is situated at 38 km west of Pishin. The district headquarter is in “Chaman” town. The district is located in the north-east of Balochistan, sharing its northern and western boundaries with Afghanistan. Pishin District is in the east and Quetta District is in the south.

Like Pishin, district Killa Abdullah is mostly inhibited by 'Pashtoons'. Major tribes include Kakar, Tareen, Syed and Achakzai. Kakars are in the majority in Tehsil Gulistan, while Achakzai dominate Tehsil Chaman. There is no ethnic differentiation among them, because they speak a common language, have the same religion and share common cultural values. Their historical background is a shared one. They are descendants of 'Qais Abdul Rashid'. Their mode of living is almost identical. The major source of income for the residents of Tehsil Chaman is quite different from that of the residents of Tehsil Gulistan. The majority of the male population in Tehsil Chaman is engaged in trade and commerce. Some of them have trade links with foreign countries such as Japan, Hong Kong, Korea etc. Tehsil Chaman has a long border with Afghanistan. Pashtoons residing in Afghanistan share a similar language and cultural background. Therefore, visa restrictions are not strictly followed by the local residents on either side of the border. Chaman is the major centre for smuggling activities. It is a paradise for smugglers from both sides of the border. Contrary to this, in Tehsil Gulistan horticulture is the back-bone of the economy. Indeed, Abdulla Khan Achakzai was the man who provided the impetus for fruit growing in this area. Wherever water is available the first preference of the farmer is fruit production. In this part of the district, horticulture/agriculture has been organized along modern lines. Flock owning is also an important source of income for people in both tehsils. Some persons are engaged in the transport sector, while for others, a government job is their source of income.

Wheat is the major crop for the Rabi Season. Apple, Apricot, Grapes, Peach and Pomegranate are the leading fruits of the district.

District Killa Abdullah has enormous potential in livestock sector which provides livelihood to many poor families. Mostly the nomadic population depends on livestock, who resides in the northern part of the district. Livestock farming is a traditional activity in the district and comprises mostly Goats, Sheep, Cows, Buffaloes, Cattle, Camels and Asses. Sheep and Goat constitutes the major portion of the livestock population in District Killa Abdullah.

The major mineral of the area is Antimony, which is an element and important metal; occur as native metal in nature. The Ore of this metal is in the form of Sulphide or Oxide. Important Oxide minerals are valentinite (Sb2 S3) Stibilonite (Sb2 O4 H O).

In Killa Abdullah District, manufacturing units are present including flour mills, carpet centres and ice factories. Embroidery is the prominent female economic activity. Carpentry at minor scale has been observed with no leather manufacturing in the district.

Killa Abdullah lies adjacent to Afghanistan therefore; there is a trade route between these countries. Both legal and illegal (smuggling) trade takes place. From Afghanistan fresh and dried fruit, timber, cotton and sheep and goat skins are imported into Pakistan and its magnitude can be derived from the number of trucks coming into Pakistan. It should be noted that transit trade to India also takes place via Chaman. This is only one side of the picture. The major part of trading activities is not documented due to its illegal nature. Normally food items, particularly wheat, sugar and edible oil are smuggled to Afghanistan, while a number of products of Afghan origin and merchandise items of foreign origin are smuggled into Killa Abdullah district via Chaman. The economic effects of these activities are that there is normally a shortage of wheat and edible oil in Killa Abdullah and adjoining districts. Due to this available foreign goods are inexpensive, thus, discouraging industrial development.","3,293",,"97,210",4,36,"757,758",230.11,110.45,"149,342","608,236","397,591","359,982",5,,,,,,,53111,,,,,0.641,1922,,88,6,1602,,7,1,10,69,,361030,100,95,53,13,79,480,43,34,,56.98,16.32,40.91,24.17,2,Balochistan

There is one government poultry farm and small-scale private/commercial poultry farms of broiler and layer breeds.

District Kohlu remained as one of the geologically least investigated area due to prevailing remoteness and political situation. Kishk range of mountains covered the majority of the districts' area, which varies from 1,200 to 1,700 meters. Sedimentary rocks ranges are having age from cretaceous to pleistocene along with Quaternary alluvium. They are grouped into cretaceous Mughalkit and Pab formations; Paleocene Rakhijaj and Dungan formations; Eocene Shaheed Gat; Ghaziz, Toi, Drug, Barka, Ha bib Tahi, Domanda, Pikoh and Drazund formation; Oligocene Chitarwata, Miocen/Pleistocene Dada formation; Narahan Levey post; Fazalchel. Mawand and Kahan area show carbonaceous material. The occurrence of carbonaceous matter has economic significance as a source for the hydrocarbon generation; thus, these areas hold good potential for localization of coal and hydrocarbon reserves. Fluorite and Silica sand deposits are also reported from private mine owners, Gypsum deposits are found in the Girsini area, the host formation are Eocene Barka and Domanda formations. There are two exposed beds of Gypsum in the Girsine area. The lower bed is 7 meters thick while the upper bed is buried under the alluvium.

Fisheries sector is a blessing for the people living in coastal belt of the district. 178 km long coast, including Gaddani and Damb (Sonmiani) is blessed with all kinds of fish and being close to Karachi possesses flourishing business opportunities and activities for fish business. Fishing sector is considered to be the mainstay of the economy for coastal community as agriculture is very limited in coastal areas due to barren lands. Karachi is the main market, where fish are transported from Gaddani for export.

Apart from famous Pomfret, the coastal stretch is full of various other species and qualities of fishes such as Sowan, Bam, Mushka, Dotar, Mangla and small size Chuki.

Major minerals deposits found in the district are Lead, Zinc, Manganese, Chromite, Serpentine, Dimension stone, Red ocher, Iron ore and Barite. The potential in Dimensional stones encouraged Government of Balochistan to establish Marble city at Hub where the blocks of dimension stones are processed for cutting and polishing to some extent. It has also created Job opportunities and brought revenue to the Government exchequer. All materials are mostly transported to Karachi, which is the main hub of business for Dimensional stones in the country. Dimension stone of good quality are being mined at Kanraj, Loai, Shah Noorani and Durraje etc. Huge deposits of fossil ferrous and non-fossil ferrous dimension stone of different colors are exposed from the ground surface and are being mined through quarries. Various kinds of rocks such as Limestone, Granite and Sandstone are used in building's construction as Dimensional stones.

Limestone deposits of good quality were discovered near Hub and used as basic raw material for Portland cement, which created significant economic opportunity and employment for the people of District Lasbela.

Quartzitic sandstone of the time of Jurassic age (150 million years old) has also been discovered. 16 km east of Lasbela located is a site called Bankhari, where Barite deposits are found in scattered veins. Kundi deposits are at about 64 Km north of Bela town, where traces of chalcopyrite and silver have been observed. The Ore found in the area contains small amount of Galena as well.

The Opholitic belt of Bela consists of Manganese ore bodies associated with volcanic rocks having a concentration range from 15% to 30%.

The well-known locations of Manganese are Kharrari Nai, Siro Dhoro, Sanjro Dhoro, Bhamparni, Gaddani Ridge and Dadi Dhoro. Manganese, Quartzite, Chromite, Iron Ore, Serpentine are also found in Ultra basic rocks (Dunite, Serpentinite) exposed towards Wadh area. Quartzite has its large deposits in Gajri Nai, which are used in steel industry. Manganese, Chromite, Iron Ore and Serpentine deposits are of economic value and are being mined by private sector.
In Duddar (at a distance of 135 km from Karachi), Lead-Zinc deposits are major venues for foreign investment. These resources are being mined in a collaboration of Balochistan Development Authority and Metallurgical Construction Company (MCC) of China. Material such as gravel and sand are being mined at Hub Nadi, majority of which are transported to Karachi for construction purposes.

In Lasbela, 166 manufacturing units were present till the end of 2010. About 36 listed companies of Karachi Stock Exchange are located in Industrial Estate of Lasbela. Major Industrial Estates in the district are at Hub and Winder, where most of the industries are of textile, auto parts, electric cables, chemicals and plastics.

Sor range-Degari-Sinjidi-Pir Ismail Ziarat/Marwar Coal fields are well known in District Quetta. These coal deposits were identified in 1891 with 61 million ton of reserves. Coal is found at 28 Km east and south-east from Quetta. It is sub-bituminous in quality and contains low proportions and sculpture contents. Quetta is the nearest railway station for the Sor range, Spez and, Degari & Pir Ismail Ziarat coal fields, which have depth of 1,100 meters.

Pir Ismail Ziarat is 60 Km east of Quetta and covered over 20 square kilometers having two seams- upper and lower seams, while their thickness ranges between 0.6-0.7 meters and 0.4-0.45 meters respectively; while, their depth ranges between 200-1,000 meters. These fields are the major coal producing area of the country where besides Coal, Limestone, Fluorite and Ordinary stone is produced in significant quantity. Fluorite mineralization in Quetta District occurs in Chiltan Limestone of Jurassic age. Fluorite occurs in veins in fracture zones. Several hundred meters thick Limestone at places Dolomite occurs in Chiltan formation of Jurassic age in Quetta (Brewery Gorge)

There are two Industrial Estates in Quetta. The first one is located at Sirki road, it is considered as Mini Industrial Estate. The other is located at Sariab By-Pass, 13 Km away from Quetta, which was established in 1986-87. All the utility requirements are available.

Quetta is a trade route leading to Afghanistan and Iran therefore; it is a transit route between these countries. Trade takes place legally as well as illegally (smuggling). From Afghanistan, fresh as well as dry fruit, timber, cotton, sheep and goat skins are imported into Pakistan. Similarly from Iran, petrol, blankets, plastic goods, carpets, dried fruit, hosiery goods, and fresh fruit e.g. cherries and tinned fruits come into the country. Veterinary medicines and medicines for human consumption are smuggled into Quetta. The magnitude of import can be gauged from the number of trucks coming into Pakistan. It should be remembered that transit trade to India also takes place via Quetta. 

A greater proportion of trading activities is not possible to be documented due to the illegal nature of the trade. Normally food items particularly wheat, ugar and edible oil are smuggled to Afghanistan, while a number of products of Afghan origin and merchandised items of foreign origin are smuggled into Quetta District via Chaman. Adverse economic effects of these activities result in shortage of wheat and edible oil etc. in Quetta and adjoining districts. Foreign goods are available at cheaper rates, discouraging industrial development. The retail trade has flourished over the years, due to smuggling.",2653,85547,276711,3,67,2275699,650.01,110.37,1001205,1274494,1193913,1081755,31,,,,,,,11244,16675507,2160,235057,224643,0.213,1958,,328713,12,43225,,48,8,2265,957,,301811,92,100,71,69,98,445,96,96,,50.98,20.04,29.4,37.19,56,Balochistan

The main source of subsistence is agriculture. Majority of the population has migrated to United Arab Emirates for earnings rationale.

The district geography is typical of a mountain eco-system where the livelihood of inhabitants/communities mainly depends upon livestock and rain fed agriculture. The natural Dry Temperate Forests of Chilghoza Pine and Sub Tropical Broadleaved Evergreen Scrub forests of Olive and Phulai, which occupy large areas in the district, play pivotal role in this regard. These forests act as grazing grounds by providing forage to a large number of livestock and also serves as water harvesting areas for supporting the rain fed agriculture. Further, local community members also depend upon these forests for fulfilling their requirements of fuel wood and small timber. In addition to the grazing and fuel wood, local community members also make use of some of the Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) for household consumption and sometimes also for sale in the local market. However, the most important role that these forests are playing in the economy of the district is by serving as major watersheds for the low altitude areas.",2800,,21213,1,13,153116,,124.78,0,153116,"84,994","68,115",7,,,,,,,178658,,,,,0.526,1505,,,0,0,,1,0,0,12,,38658,0,55,0,15,61,176,12,6,,69.8,6.82,21.59,17.61,0,Balochistan

District Kotli has rich history that can be assessed by the fact that there is this huge fort near Khoiratta in Kharjai village high overlooking the Banaah valley. 

In November 1947, Indian Army reached Kotli and evacuated the garrisons of the town. Pakistani Army along with the local population and aided by the tribesmen of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa arrived and counter-attacked, forcing the Indian Army to abandon it. Kotli has been under Pakistani administration since. 26Km from Kotli city there is a mythical destination Tattapani, where thousands of people flock in to take a bath in natural Sulphur Springs each year in the hope to find magical cures for illnesses. Kotli was a sub-division of Mirpur District up to the year 1975. 

Now district Kotli is the second largest district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir after district Neelum in terms of area whereas in terms of population and administrative affairs it stands ahead of all the districts of the state of AJ&K.

Geographically district Kotli lies between 3330’20”N and 7353’57”E coordinates at the altitude of 2057 feet meters above sea level. District Kotli is bounded by Indian Occupied Kashmir in the east, by district Mirpur in the south and Poonch to its north.

Kotli is connected to Islamabad via Kahuta at the distance of 141 kms, from Mirpur by two metaled roads, one via Gulpur -Rajdhani (90 kms) and the other via Dhungi - Charohi. It is also directly linked with Islamabad and Rawalpindi via Sehnsa and Holar through a 117 kms black topped road. District Kotli is also directly linked with Rawalakot via Trarkhal (82 kms).

River Poonch is the main river in the area and enters Kotli from the north at TattaPani and flows south passing west of Kotli town and finally enters Mirpur district before flowing into Mangla Lake. Jhelum
river makes the western boundary of the district and flows in northsouth direction. The Rangpur Nala is an important western tributary of the Poonch River while two important streams namely Ban Nala and
Mahuli Nala join it from the east. The River Poonch passes through Kotli to be joined by a smaller river called the Baan at Brahli, a short distance from Kotli.

District Kotli is a hilly area with narrow valleys and these hills gradually rise towards the high mountains of Poonch district, which are covered with coniferous trees. The average height in the eastern and central part of the district is about 1000 meters above sea level. The rest of
the area is less than 1000 meters in altitude.

Agriculture is the backbone of the district Kotli. The topographic features of district Kotli are same having predominantly hilly terrain with very few big plain contours. The major crops of the district are maize and wheat. but at some places rice, gram, bajra and jawar are also cultivated on smaller land units.

Camels can also be seen domesticated by the residents of the district. Poultry birds are also reared for egg and white meat.

The mountains of district Kotli are home to many species of trees like pine, kail, fir, shisham, kikar, willow, walnut, chinar and mannu.

128,Mirpur,"District Mirpur is named after the main city, Mirpur; which is the capital of Mirpur district and is the largest city of Azad Kashmir. The Mirpur city was founded by the Ghakhar chief Miran Shah Ghazi around 1640 AD. Since then this area was ruled and captured by different rulers and warlords in different eras. But finally on March 16, 1846 a treaty was signed (Treaty of Amritsar) between the British East India Company and Raja Gulab Singh setting the fate of the Mirpur with the new state of Jammu & Kashmir. During the British colonial times, Mirpur was one of the five districts of the Jammu province in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. It consisted of three tehsils; Kotli, Mirpur and Bhimber. Kotli and Bhimber have since been made into separate districts.

Mirpur lies on 33.1491N latitude and 73.7534 E longitudes. It is 134 kms away from Islamabad and 190 kms from Lahore via Dina through Grand Trunk Road. Mirpur city is also connected to Bhimber (49 kms) and Kotli (99 kms) districts of the state of AJ&K. District Mirpur is bounded by district Kotli in the north and east, by Potohar (Punjab) in the west and by district Bhimber in the south.

The agricultural scenario of district Mirpur is in good shape mainly due to the availability of bigger units of plain lands for farming. The people of this district prefer to grow wheat, maize and millet. Rice is also grown. Pulses of different kinds are also grown along with vegetables.  Cattle, buffalos and sheep and goats are mostly reared in the peripheries and outskirts of the district. These farm animals are reared mainly for the domestic need of meat and milk. These animals also help the farmers in their fields for different farm practices. Poultry birds are also reared for egg and white meat. In addition to these animals, horses, mules and donkeys are also reared for load bearing tasks.

This southern part of the state of AJ&K is not mountainous and hence the presence of the forests is negligible.

The industrial zone of the district of Mirpur is comparatively rich in terms of the industries established and working in it. One of the main reasons for its richness is the geographical location of the district of Mirpur which is adjacent and easily accessible from the big cities of Pakistan like Lahore and Rawalpindi / Islamabad. The Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has successfully endeavored to develop Mirpur as an industrial place and promote private investment for establishing, foam, polypropylene, synthetic yarn, motorbikes and scooter, textile, vegetable Oil (Ghee), wood and sawmills, soap, cosmetics, marble, ready‐made garments, matches and rosin, turpentine industrial units in the area.  ","1,010",6502.720665,,2,18,"456,200",452,102.84,"181,416","274,784","231,285","224,899",16,,24,,,,,"33,437",,,,,Vulnerable,"1,419",,"4,918",17,,,48,2,46,141,,"628,301",,,,0,,288,85,90,4,80.94,41.32,34.93,28.31,,AJK

The name Muzaffarabad is derived from its founder’s name Sultan Muzaffar Khan. The district was administratively divided into three sub-divisions: Muzaffarabad, Hattian and Authmaqam up to 2004. After the establishment of district Neelum, it retained two sub divisions as Authmuqam was included in district Neelum.

The city of Muzaffarabad is located at the confluence of Jhelum and Neelum rivers. North of the district Muzaffarabad is much colder than the south.

Among the mountains are valleys and terraces used for cultivation. Main crops are maize, wheat, rice, oil seed, potato, pulses and variety of vegetables. Besides, the area is famous for fruits such as apple, walnut, pear, plum and apricot.

The two rivers passing through the valley, Jehlum and Neelum, originate from Indian occupied Kashmir. There is no extensive canal system and farming is largely dependent on rain water and small channels connected to perennial water sources. The district is blessed with rich forest which covers 59% of the area and is a major source of income. Important tree species are Deodar, Blue Pine, Fir (Spruce) and Chir among the coniferous trees and Walnut, Ash, Maple, Poplar, Willow and Oak among the broad leaved trees. Muzaffarabad also has rich mineral deposits such as Limonite, Marble, Ruby, Green Tourmaline and Dolomite.

People of Muzaffarabad have diverse means of livelihood. Farming, forestry and livestock rearing are the main occupations, particularly among rural households. Poultry farming is also common. Besides, ponies and donkeys are kept for carrying load to heights.
